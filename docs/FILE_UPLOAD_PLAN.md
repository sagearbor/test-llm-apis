# File Upload Feature - Development Plan

## Overview

Add ability for users to upload files (documents, code, images) and ask the LLM to analyze them.

---

## Security Considerations (CRITICAL)

### 🔴 Major Security Risks:
1. **Malicious File Upload**: Users could upload executable files, scripts, malware
2. **File Size Bombs**: Large files could exhaust memory/storage
3. **Path Traversal**: Malicious filenames could access server files
4. **Code Injection**: File content could contain malicious code
5. **PII/Sensitive Data**: Users might upload confidential documents
6. **Storage Costs**: Files need to be stored temporarily
7. **Cross-User Access**: User A shouldn't access User B's files

### ✅ Security Mitigations:

#### 1. File Type Restrictions

**Whitelist (Comprehensive for developers, data managers, and managers):**

**Documents:**
- .txt, .md, .rtf - Plain text
- .pdf - PDF documents
- .docx, .doc - Microsoft Word
- .xlsx, .xls - Microsoft Excel
- .pptx, .ppt - Microsoft PowerPoint
- .odt, .ods, .odp - OpenOffice/LibreOffice
- .csv, .tsv - Data files

**Code & Scripts:**
- .py - Python
- .js, .ts - JavaScript/TypeScript
- .java, .kt - Java/Kotlin
- .cpp, .c, .h - C/C++
- .cs - C#
- .go - Go
- .rs - Rust
- .rb - Ruby
- .php - PHP
- .swift - Swift
- .r, .R - R
- .sql - SQL
- .scala - Scala
- .sh - Shell scripts (READ ONLY - never execute)
- .ps1 - PowerShell (READ ONLY - never execute)

**Data & Config:**
- .json, .jsonl - JSON data
- .xml - XML data
- .yaml, .yml - YAML config
- .toml - TOML config
- .ini, .cfg - Config files
- .env.example - Example env files (NOT .env)

**Data Science & BI:**
- .ipynb - Jupyter notebooks
- .pbix - Power BI files (ZIP-based, extract .json)
- .rmd - R Markdown
- .parquet - Parquet data files (extract metadata)

**Web:**
- .html, .htm - HTML
- .css, .scss, .sass - Stylesheets
- .jsx, .tsx - React
- .vue - Vue.js
- .svelte - Svelte

**Markup & Documentation:**
- .tex - LaTeX
- .rst - reStructuredText
- .adoc - AsciiDoc

**BLOCKED (Security Risk):**
- .exe, .dll, .so, .dylib - Executables/libraries
- .bat, .cmd - Windows batch files (can execute)
- .app - macOS applications
- .msi, .deb, .rpm - Installers
- .jar - Java archives (can execute)
- .scr, .vbs - Script executables
- .apk, .ipa - Mobile apps
- .env - Environment files (secrets)

**Special Handling (ZIP-based formats):**
- .docx, .xlsx, .pptx - Extract XML content
- .pbix - Extract data model JSON
- .ipynb - Parse as JSON
- .odt, .ods - Extract XML content
- .zip - Generic ZIP archives (with recursive validation)

**ZIP File Support:**
- ✅ Allowed: Generic .zip files
- ✅ Recursive validation: Each file inside ZIP checked against whitelist
- ✅ Nested ZIPs: Supported up to 2 levels deep
- ✅ Security limits:
  * Max uncompressed size: 50MB (prevent zip bombs)
  * Max files in archive: 100 files
  * Max nesting depth: 2 levels
  * Compression ratio check: Reject if >100:1 (zip bomb detection)
- ✅ Only whitelisted files extracted (others skipped)
- ⚠️ Blocked files in ZIP: Silently skipped, logged
- ⚠️ Executable files in ZIP: Rejected, entire ZIP blocked

**Note**: All files converted to text before sending to LLM. No code execution.

#### 2. File Size Limits
- **Max file size**: 10MB (configurable)
- **Max files per user**: 5 concurrent
- **Rate limiting**: Max 10 uploads per hour per user

#### 3. File Storage
- **Temporary storage**: Files deleted after analysis
- **Session-based**: Each user's files isolated by session ID
- **Auto-cleanup**: Delete files after 1 hour or on logout
- **No persistent storage**: Files never saved to disk permanently

#### 4. Content Sanitization
- **Strip metadata**: Remove EXIF, author info, etc.
- **Scan for malicious content**: Basic virus/malware check
- **Text extraction only**: Convert all files to plain text before LLM
- **No code execution**: Never execute uploaded code

#### 5. Access Control
- **Session isolation**: Files tagged with session ID
- **OAuth required**: Must be authenticated to upload
- **User-specific paths**: Each user has isolated temp directory
- **Auto-delete on logout**: Clean up all user files

#### 6. Azure OpenAI Safety
- **Content filters**: Azure's built-in safety filters
- **No file persistence in prompts**: Files processed, then discarded
- **Audit logging**: Log all file uploads with user ID

## Architecture Design

### File Processing Flow:
```
1. User uploads file (browser)
   ↓
2. Server validates file (type, size, MIME)
   ↓
3. Store in temporary session-specific directory
   ↓
4. Extract text content (convert PDF, DOCX, etc. to text)
   ↓
5. Sanitize content (remove metadata, check for malicious content)
   ↓
6. Send to Azure OpenAI with user's question
   ↓
7. Return response to user
   ↓
8. Auto-delete file after response OR 1 hour timeout
```

### Storage Strategy:
- **Option A**: In-memory storage (simplest, no disk I/O)
  - Pros: Fast, no cleanup needed, secure
  - Cons: Lost on restart, limited by RAM

- **Option B**: Temporary disk storage (recommended)
  - Pros: Handles large files, survives restart
  - Cons: Need cleanup mechanism
  - Location: `/tmp/llm-uploads/{sessionId}/{fileId}`

**Recommendation**: Option B with aggressive cleanup

### File Structure:
```
/tmp/llm-uploads/
  ├── {session-id-1}/
  │   ├── {file-id-1}.txt
  │   └── {file-id-2}.pdf.txt
  └── {session-id-2}/
      └── {file-id-3}.json
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes:

#### 1. New Dependencies

npm install multer         # File upload middleware
npm install file-type      # MIME type detection
npm install pdf-parse      # PDF text extraction
npm install mammoth        # DOCX text extraction
npm install sanitize-filename  # Secure filenames
```

#### 2. New API Endpoints

**POST /api/upload**
- Upload file
- Returns: `{ fileId, filename, size, uploadedAt }`

**POST /chat** (modified)
- Accept optional `fileId` parameter
- Include file content in LLM prompt

**DELETE /api/files/:fileId**
- Manually delete uploaded file

**GET /api/files**
- List user's uploaded files

#### 3. New Modules

- Validate file safety

**`upload-middleware.js`**
- Multer configuration
- File validation
- Size/type restrictions

**`cleanup-service.js`**
- Background job to delete old files
- Run every 10 minutes
- Delete files older than 1 hour

### Frontend Changes:

- File picker button
- File list with delete buttons
- Progress indicator
- File size/type validation (client-side)

**Updated Chat Interface**
- Show attached files in chat
- Clear visual indicator when file is included
- Option to remove file from context

#### 2. Client-Side Validation
- Check file size before upload
- Check file extension
- Show errors immediately

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Malicious file upload | Medium | High | Strict file type whitelist, content scanning |
| Storage exhaustion | Low | Medium | File size limits, aggressive cleanup |
| Privacy concerns | Medium | High | Session isolation, auto-delete, no logging of content |
| PII leakage | Medium | High | Warning messages, OAuth required, audit logs |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Streaming, size limits, rate limiting |
| Cross-user access | Low | High | Session-based isolation, OAuth checks |

---

## Open Questions

1. Should files persist across page refresh? (Current plan: No, tied to session)
2. Should we support ZIP files? (Initial: No, security risk)
3. Should we scan for PII automatically? (Initial: No, just warn users)
4. Should we allow multiple files per message? (Initial: One file per message)
5. Should we support images? (Initial: Yes, but convert to text description via GPT-4 Vision if available)

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- [ ] Support for ZIP files (with extraction)
- [ ] Image analysis with GPT-4 Vision
- [ ] File sharing between users
- [ ] Persistent file storage
- [ ] File version history
- [ ] Collaborative document analysis
- [ ] Integration with OneDrive/SharePoint
- [ ] Real-time collaborative editing
